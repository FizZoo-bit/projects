        <p><strong>Align Probiotic Extra Strength</strong> is a widely recommended probiotic supplement that has been clinically proven to help with digestive issues like gas, bloating, and irregular bowel movements.</p>

<p>Its active ingredient is <strong>Bifidobacterium 35624â„¢</strong>, a patented strain that has been shown in clinical studies to strengthen and balance the gut microbiome. Align stands out in the probiotic world due to its consistency and the rigor of its research backing.</p>

<p>This extra strength version offers twice the CFU count of the original, making it ideal for those with more serious or chronic digestive issues. Users have reported improvements in gut regularity within a few weeks of daily use.</p>

<p>Align is also extremely gentle, which makes it suitable for sensitive stomachs. Unlike many probiotics, it's designed to survive stomach acid so the bacteria actually reach your intestines where they're needed.</p>

<p>Another benefit? The product has a solid reputation in the medical community and is often recommended by gastroenterologists.</p>
