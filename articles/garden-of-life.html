        <p><strong>Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics</strong> is one of the most trusted probiotics on the market today. Developed by Dr. David Perlmutter, a certified neurologist and expert in the human microbiome, this product is tailored for those looking to support both digestive and immune health.</p>

<p>Each capsule delivers <strong>50 billion CFU (colony-forming units)</strong> and includes a diverse set of strains such as <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium lactis</em>. These strains are known to help with digestive balance, relieve occasional bloating, and enhance nutrient absorption.</p>

<p>This supplement is also shelf-stable, meaning it doesn’t need refrigeration—a major convenience factor. It is also <strong>gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free</strong>, making it ideal for those with dietary sensitivities.</p>

<p>Studies suggest that diverse probiotic strains can help support your microbiome, which is increasingly linked to mental clarity, immune response, and even mood. The addition of prebiotic fiber in this formula helps nourish the good bacteria so they thrive in your gut.</p>

<p>If you're serious about your gut health and want a probiotic that is backed by science and trusted by thousands of users, Garden of Life Dr. Formulated is a top-tier choice.</p>
